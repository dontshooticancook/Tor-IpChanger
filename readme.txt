Okey, 

So what the fuck is this? 


For long time, I wanted to change TOR IP using terminal. Programatically? whatever that is... 


Did I use it? Yes, I used it when I was behind tor and polipo and I was getting too many 504 Socks Rejected messages. I mean, WTF! I dont like my program getting that! I coded it for other things. So, the best option was to change the fucking ip as much times as possible so that the error wont be popping up ever again. 



What is this program doing, and where will it work? 

Basically it is a shell script that could be invoked from a terminal. (How and what you use it for? None of my business!)

What is expect? Its a command that will expect for output from stdout (I guess, u want more code, go man expect)

And install it before using it. For Debs, I think sudo apt-get install expect can do the magic. 

What else?
Make torrc working, configure your control port and password. I mean, if you are going to need this file, I think you know what to do :D.

If you think this is a stupid program, well fuck you.. Mind your business ;) 


Use this along with ARM and you can see the amount of connetions it make and stuff! 

So, download it, execute it as you wish! Go ahead. 


And who am I?

I am a nobody. I love to learn, I love to hack, I love to fuck.. Just like that...
